    description: >-
      A dynamic tree arranges data in a binary tree to accelerate queries such as volume queries and ray casts.

      Leafs are proxies with an AABB. In the tree we expand the proxy AABB by Settings.b2_fatAABBFactor so that the proxy

      AABB is bigger than the client object. This allows the client object to move by small amounts without triggering a

      tree

      update. Nodes are pooled and relocatable, so we use node indices rather than pointers.

      The broad-phase is used for computing pairs and performing volume queries and ray casts. This broad-phase does

      not persist pairs. Instead, this reports potentially new pairs. It is up to the client to consume the new pairs and

      to

      track subsequent overlap.
