      A shape is used for collision detection. You can create a shape however you like. Shapes used for simulation

      in World are created automatically when a Fixture is created. Shapes may encapsulate a one or more child shapes.

      A shape is 2D geometrical object, such as a circle or polygon.

      url: Alis.Core.Physic.Collision.Shapes.ChainShape.html
    description: >-
      A chain shape is a free form sequence of line segments. The chain has one-sided collision, with the surface

      normal pointing to the right of the edge. This provides a counter-clockwise winding like the polygon shape.

      Connectivity information is used to create smooth collisions. Warning: the chain will not collide properly if there

      are

      self-intersections.

    description: >-
      A line segment (edge) shape. These can be connected in chains or loops to other edge shapes. Edges created

      independently are two-sided and do no provide smooth movement across junctions.
