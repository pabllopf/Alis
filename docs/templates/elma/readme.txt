Change Testimonials Slider Properties
- Open for editing js/scripts.js
- Find the section /* Card Slider - Swiper */
- And then fiddle with the settings using the documentation here: https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api


-----------------------------------------------------


Update statistics number settings
- To change the statistics numbers find the /* Counter */ section and update the data-purecounter-end="" attribute
- You can also set the speed of each counter with data-purecounter-duration="3"
- The count speed can be adjusted to have all counters finish almost at the same time
- If you give bigger numbers less time to be counted to then they will finish close the the smaller ones
