# 2. Basic Concepts

Before begin to create your own video game with ALIS, you must
know about the following aspects:

### Scene

A video game is made up of one or more assumptions called
'Scenes'. A scene or 'Scene', is composed by one or multiple
objects named 'GameObjects'.

### GameObject

A GameObject is an element of the video game that is inside
a 'Scene' and containing components that attribute characteristics to it
special that define and differentiate it from the rest of 'Scenes'.

### Transform

The 'transform' is a special property of the gameobjects that it represents
its position, rotation and size scale inside the Scene.

### Component

A 'Component' represents a special characteristic of a
gameobject. In Alis there are 5 implemented components that allow
streamline development. Although it is also possible to create your own
components.


1.  Sprite: It is a component that allows you to assign an image to a
    GameObjects.

2.  Camera: This component allows you to assign a camera with certain
    features to a GameObjects.

3.  Audiosource: This component lets you assign sounds to the
    GameObjects.

4.  Animator: This component allows you to create animation trees that
    could be used by other components to integrate move to GameObjects.

5.  Collision: This component allows you to generate collisions and make
    GameObjects can recognize/interact with each other.
