# Security Policy

GitHub takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code
repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/GitHub).

Even
though [open source repositories are outside of the scope of our bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/index.html#scope)
and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate
maintainers for remediation.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GitHub-owned repository, please report it to us through
coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to opensource-security[@]github.com.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

Security policy
Brand promise
Keeping users safe and secure is a top priority for us at remark. We welcome the contribution of external security
researchers.

Scope
If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any software, service, or website governed by remark, we encourage you
to notify us.

Projects governed by remark sometimes do unsafe things by design (such as a plugin that executes arbitrary code or an
option that is dangerous). This unsafe behavior should be explicitly documented and, if it is, is not considered a
security issue.

There are no hard and fast rules to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a security issue or a “regular” issue. When
in doubt, please do send us a report.

How to submit a report
Security issues can be reported by sending an email to security@unifiedjs.com, which will go to all unified collective
core team members. The team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours. You will receive a more detailed response
within 96 hours.

We will create a maintainer security advisory on GitHub to discuss internally, and when needed, invite you to the
advisory.

Safe harbor
remark supports safe harbor for security researchers who:

Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our
services
Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder. If you do encounter Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) contact us immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local
information
Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior to any disclosure to the public or a
third-party
We will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute “authorised” conduct and will not pursue
civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement. We will help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated
by a third party against you
Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.

Preferences
Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly defined impact
Submit one vulnerability per report
Social engineering (such as phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited
