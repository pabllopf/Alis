# 1. Quick Start

Before starting with the installation, .NET CORE 5.0 or superior is required in your system.

1.  To know if you have .NET CORE installed and the version, open a command prompt.

    -   Windows: search 'cmd' and open 'command prompt'.

    -   MacOS: go to 'utilities' and select 'terminal'.

    -   Linux: right click on your desktop and click 'terminal'.

2.  In the command prompt, enter the following command:
    
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
    dotnet --list-sdks
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.  If you have .NET CORE installed, you should see the following lines:

In case of having a previous version, getting "'dotnet' is not recognized as an internal or external command" or another kind of error, you must install the latest version.

-   To ease the installation process we have prepared the following table, with a direct download button for each version.

## Core and/or Tools

If you want to work with Alis without the Editor, you are able to add its core and/or tools to your visual studio project.

Executing the following command inside your working directory will configure your entire project to access the core functionality.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}  
dotnet add package Alis.Core-SFML --version 1.3.6
