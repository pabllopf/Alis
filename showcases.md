## Pong 
Pong (or Tele-Pong) was a first generation video game published by Atari, created by Nolan Bushnell and released on November 29, 1972. Pong is based on the sport of table tennis (or ping pong). The word Pong is a trademark of Atari Interactive, while the generic word "pong" is used to describe the "bat and ball" genre of video games.
