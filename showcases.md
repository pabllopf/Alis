## Pong

Pong (or Tele-Pong) was a first generation video game published by Atari, created by Nolan Bushnell and released on
November 29, 1972. Pong is based on the sport of table tennis (or ping pong). The word Pong is a trademark of Atari
Interactive, while the generic word "pong" is used to describe the "bat and ball" genre of video games.

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls a paddle in the game by moving it
vertically on the left side of the screen, and can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another
human player who controls a second paddle on the opposite side. Players can use the paddles to hit the ball one way or
the other. The objective is for one of the players to score more points than the opponent at the end of the game. These
points are obtained when the opposing player fails to return the ball.

## Snake

Snake (sometimes also called Serpent) is a video game released in the mid-1970s that has remained popular ever since,
becoming a classic. In 1998, Snake gained a massive audience after becoming a standard pre-recorded game on Nokia
phones.

In the game, the player or user controls a long, thin, snake-like creature that wanders around a bounded plane,
collecting food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the "walls". surrounding the playing area.
Every time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, causing the game to increase in difficulty. The user
controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right) and the snake's body follows. Also, the player
cannot stop the movement of the snake while the game is running.

### How to play

Press the keyboard key 'Enter' to start the game and use the keyboard keys W, S, D, A to move the snake.
