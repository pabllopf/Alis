# 4. Core

The core of Alis includes everything you need to build your own video game. For this, it has a fluent API that facilitates the integration of the different elements and also includes several predefined components to facilitate the development.

## Create your first video game

To create a project with Alis, using the Core only, it is very easy. With only 5 commands you can have a project ready in visual studio 2019.

``` 
dotnet new console -n MyNameGame
cd MyNameGame
dotnet add package Alis.Core-SFML --version 1.3.6
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Once the process has been completed, there should appear a \ "Hello World \". Next, it should be tested that everything works correctly adding the following in the file \ "Program.cs \" recently created.

``` 
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    VideoGame.TestSFML();
}
```

If everything is correctly configured and installed it should appear
the next:

### Sample project

If it is your first time using visual studio 2019 or you just want to start with a base project, I have created a complete example based on the classic game of 'Ping Pong'.
