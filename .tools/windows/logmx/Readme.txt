  What is it? 
  -----------

LogMX is an easy-to-use cross platform tool for developers and administrators 
working with log & trace files.

Using a nice graphical interface, LogMX displays log & trace files content, 
allowing filters on levels (e.g. INFO, WARNING, ...) and emitters (e.g. classes,
packages, function, process, ...)

LogMX was designed to read all log & trace formats from local or remote files: 
user can learn LogMX how to read new file formats using GUI configuration or
easy-to-write plugins, and learn it new log levels directly through 
application options (LogMX is delivered with common parser plugins for user 
convenience, such as Log4J and LogFactor5 formats).

LogMX provides many other useful features such as: Search (regular expression 
or not), Export, Auto-refresh, Elapsed time computation, File deletion or flush,
Alerts, Console mode,...


  Install / Update / Uninstall  (using Windows installer)
  -------------------------------------------------------
  
To install, just execute the installer and follow the installer steps.

To update, just execute the installer and follow the installer steps (your LogMX
configuration will be preserved).

To uninstall, use the Windows Control Panel, section "Programs and Features",
and double-click on "LogMX".
Note: you can also use the uninstaller located in the LogMX directory, which 
is generated by the Windows installer during installation.


  Install / Update / Uninstall  (using the ZIP/TGZ/DMG archive)
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  
There is nothing to do to install LogMX: you only have to unpack the downloaded
ZIP/TGZ/DMG file in the directory of your choice and start LogMX the way
described in the next section.
Note: you need Java 8 or later to run LogMX (to get it, go to www.java.com).

To update an existing LogMX version while keeping its configuration, install it
to a new location, then copy the directory "config" of your previous version in
the new one. You may also want to copy directories "parsers" and "managers" if
you have created your own Java Parsers/Managers. 

To uninstall it, simply delete the LogMX directory (the one previously unziped).


  Execution
  ---------
  
Here is how to start LogMX, depending on your Operating System:
 
  * Linux/UNIX: 
    
    Simply type  ./logmx.sh  from LogMX directory, or type  <LogMXDir>/logmx.sh
    from any directory.
    If you get an error like "Cannot execute", type "chmod +x logmx.sh" in
    LogMX directory.
    You may choose to add LogMX directory to your $PATH environment variable 
    so that you can start LogMX from anywhere.
    To start LogMX to view a specific file, simply use  ./logmx.sh <file>


  * Windows:
  
    Simply double-click on the LogMX icon in the LogMX directory 
    (file 'LogMX.exe' for automatic 32/64-bits detection, or 'LogMX-64.exe' to
    force 64-bits mode).
    If you have trouble starting LogMX this way, use 'LogMX.bat' to get 
    some more detailed information on this error.
    Note: you can start LogMX using the command-line (above chapter for 
    UNIX/Linux applies by replacing 'logmx.sh' with 'LogMX.bat')
    Note: you can add an item "Open with LogMX" in Windows Explorer's popup
    menus by clicking on the button "Integrate to Windows Explorer..."
    in LogMX "Options" dialog box.


  * macOS:
  
    Simply double-click on the LogMX icon ("LogMX.app") in the LogMX 
    directory, or type  ./logmx.command  from LogMX directory in a Terminal.
    If you get an error like "Cannot execute", type "chmod +x logmx.command" in
    LogMX directory.
    You may choose to add LogMX directory to your $PATH environment variable 
    so that you can start LogMX from anywhere.
    To start LogMX to view a specific file, simply use  ./logmx.command <file>
