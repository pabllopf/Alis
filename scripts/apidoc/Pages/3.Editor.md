# 3. Editor

The Alis editor offers a cross-platform working environment (Windows,
MacOS and Debian), making it much easier to connect the elements
that make up a video game.

## First steps:

The first thing we will see when starting the editor is a window that
indicates the following lines:

1.  Create a new project: if you want to create a new project, you must
    choose the name of the project, the directory where you want to save it,
    and the type of solution or template you want to use (video games in two
    dimensions using CORE-SFML is the only option for now).
    
2.  Load a recent project: when you have already worked with the
    Editor, a section called 'Recent projects' appears,
    lets you quickly load a project you've already been with
    working. Also if you move the project from the place that
    was saved for the last time, the Editor won't detect it and will remove it
    from the list when trying load the project.

3.  Open an existing project: if you want to load a project, you just have to
    select the 'Project.json' file inside of it. It is recommended to check if
    the contents of the 'Project.json' file are right and that the directories
    really match with the project directory.
