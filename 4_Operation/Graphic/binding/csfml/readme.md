## Learn

There is no tutorial for CSFML, but since it's a binding you can use the C++ resources:

  * The [official tutorials](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/)
  * The [online API documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/)
  * The [community wiki](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/wiki/)
  * The [community forum](https://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/) (or [French](https://fr.sfml-dev.org/forums/))

Of course, you can also find the CSFML API documentation in the SDK.

## Building

Set `SFML_DIR` to a directory containing the `SFMLConfig.cmake` file, usually located at `lib/cmake/SFML`.
